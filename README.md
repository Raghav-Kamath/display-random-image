# display-random-image

I have changed the app.py to display the correct image after either a minimum number of attempts(4) or if the actual description and the entered description is >=40% similar

Updated the description in the _app.py_ file.

Replace _elon_musk.jpg_ with correct image in the static folder

Remember to change the _correct_image_path_ in the _app.py_

and add your own dummy images to static/images folder it will randomly choose between any of them
